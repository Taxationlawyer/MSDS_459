# Part Five

This writing covers Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This topic was briefly discussed in a previous section. And anyone who has diagramed (more colloquially called “Mind Mapping”) a business case in school should immediately grasp the idea behind this concept. Moreover, this same concept and the idea behind it should be instantly recognizable be any enterprising and motivated law student or practicing attorney. Such people have good practice in diagraming lengthy and convoluted legal cases. Consequently, there are three main ideas to discuss 1. Knowledge Graphs, (2) Information Extraction, and 3. Named Entity Recognition and relations of the same.

(1)	Imagine trying to get a grasp on a complicated business study or legal case. In business classes, “Mind Mapping” is commonly used. And the authors of the book entitled “Natural Language Processing in Action,” State that the idea behind a KG is similar to a mind map. This is a diagram of the key players in the business case or legal case. In real life these diagrams help the practitioner explain the situation to other people. 

(2)	In Information Extraction (IE), these devices assist in extracting relevant information. Traditional modeling methods are used to extract “relevant” information. These methods include decision trees, principal component analysis, neural networks, and other methods. This part can be tricky, because sometimes there is more than one way of stating the same fact. 

(3)	Regarding the NER process, the algorithm finds patterns that are related to names, “dates, locations, or any piece of information that can be placed … [in the] knowledge graph.” (Chapter 11, Hobson) Moreover, these entities are connected to each other with lines that represent a relation ship (e.g., “works for,” “is suing,” “lawyer for the plaintiff,” and so on).

In sum, although the web scrapping process is “automated” by software (or code—e.g., Python), human supervision is still necessary. Web scraping is a combination of human intelligence (an art) and precise data mining algorithms (a science).
